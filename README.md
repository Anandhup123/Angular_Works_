# Angular Study Project

This project is a comprehensive Angular application created for study purposes. It covers various fundamental Angular concepts and showcases different forms of data binding and form handling techniques.

## Features

### 1. Reactive Forms
- Implements reactive forms to manage complex form structures.
- Includes form validation and dynamic form controls.

### 2. Template-Driven Forms
- Demonstrates the use of template-driven forms for simpler form scenarios.
- Integrates form validation using Angular's built-in directives.

### 3. One-Way Data Binding
- Utilizes one-way data binding for displaying data from the component to the view.
- Helps maintain a clear separation of concerns between the component logic and the template.

### 4. Two-Way Data Binding
- Implements two-way data binding using `[(ngModel)]` for synchronizing the component and the view.
- Useful for scenarios where user input directly affects the componentâ€™s state.

### 5. Style Binding
- Demonstrates dynamic style binding to apply CSS styles based on component state.
- Includes examples of both inline style binding and class binding.

## Getting Started

# AngularProject1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
